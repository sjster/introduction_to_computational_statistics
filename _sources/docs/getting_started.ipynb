    "\n",
    "One you are on a course page that has a Jupyter Notebook, click on the tab located at the top right corner of the page and select 'Binder'. This deploys the notebook onto a cloud environment. This automatically pulls the Docker image and creates a working Python environment for you without any user intervention. This is the easiest way to get started using the notebooks. However, any changes made in the notebooks will not be persistent. If persistence is desired, it is recommended to use the Databricks Community Edition.\n",

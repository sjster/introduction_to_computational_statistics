    "# Setting up Your Python Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways you can set up your Python environment for the notebooks that are going to be used for the courses here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The notebooks can be downloaded from each course page by clicking the tab on the top right corner and selecting '.ipynb'.**\n",

    "## Databricks Community Edition\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks offers a [Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html) of their Data Science ecosystem for running experiments in notebooks. You can sign up for a free account and start running the notebooks for the course. The advantages of using Databricks over other Data Science ecosystems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integration with MLflow for experiment management\n",
    "* Integration with Git for version control of your notebooks\n",
    "* Integration with your AWS, GCP and Azure accounts if you so desire\n",
    "* Easy to setup a cluster for scaling your Data Science workflows\n",
    "* Collaborate and comment on notebooks with your team\n",
    "* Easily publish your notebooks for public consumption\n",

    "## Binder\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are on a course page that has a Jupyter Notebook, click on the tab located at the top right corner of the page and select 'Binder'. This deploys the notebook onto a cloud environment. Binder automatically pulls the Docker image and creates a working Python environment for you without any user intervention. This is the easiest way to get started using the notebooks. However, any changes made in the notebooks will not be persistent. If persistence is desired, it is recommended to use the Databricks Community Edition.\n",

    "-   search for Jupyter in your applications menu, or\n",

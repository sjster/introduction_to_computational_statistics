    "### Underfitting vs. Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Most folks have by now heard of underfitting and overfitting a model. Simpler models should be preferred but not at the cost of accuracy. An overfit model, on the other hand, may not generalize well on new data. We can measure how well a model fits the data using the $R^2$ metric which measures the proportion of explained variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use the example of linear regression and start with a first order regression to explain the data, we may find that the data may not be adequately captured. We may have to incrementally increase the complexity of the model by increasing the order of the polynomial. Past a certain point, however, the model starts overfitting to the data. What this means is that the model simply used its representational power to memorize the data and will perform poorly on new data that is fed into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want a model that has found that balance between being underfit and overfit, this trade-off is often referred to as the bias-variance trade-off. Bias is the error in the data resulting from its inability to accomodate the data. The model does not have the representational power to capture all the variations and patterns in the data. Variance is the error resulting from the sensitivity of the model to the data which usually results a complex model. Regularization is often used for this reason to reduce the complexity in a regression (or neural network) by minimizing the number of coefficients. "

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Cross-validation \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we divide the data into non-overlapping subsets and perform training and validation on the different subsets. Depending on how we perform this cross-validation, it can be called K-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). In K-fold cross validation we divide the data into 'K' folds or subsets, perform training of the model on k-1 folds while the model performance is assessed on the 1 fold that was left. We iteratively select each fold to be the test fold while the others become the training folds.\n",

Allan. \"Likelihood and its use in Parameter Estimation and Model Comparison.\" Mesure et évaluation en éducation, volume 37, number 3, 2015, p. 63–98. https://doi.org/10.7202/1036328ar](https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/mee/2015-v37-n3-mee02497/1036328ar/)\n",
    "\n",
    "These terms are used to measure the error in our model with regards to the data that the model is trying to fit. Most folks are familiar with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) given by \n",
    "\n",
    "MSE = $\\sum_1^n (y_{true} - y_{predicted})^2 / n$\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is a perfectly acceptably way of measuring error, another way to measure the performance of a model is using the log-likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log-likelihood = $\\sum_1^n log p(y_i | \\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the likelihood function is a Normal, the log-likelihood is proportional to the MSE. Deviance is simply -2 times the log-likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "Deviance = -2 $\\sum_1^n log p(y_i | \\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the likelihood function $p(y_i | \\theta)$ takes values from 0 for no fit to 1 for a perfectly fit model. This results in the log-likelihood function taking values from $- \\infty$ to 0. Multiplying the log-likelihood function by -2 results in a number that is interpretable similar to the MSE. Poorly fit models have large positive values while a perfectly fit model has a value of 0. This is primary reason for using deviance as opposed to the log-likelihood. Complex models will have lower deviance values on training set (in-sample data), and this needs to be penalized when comparing models. This is related to overfitting and bias that we talked about earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is based on the notion of estimating the parameters $\\theta$ that maximize the the probability $\\sum_1^n p(y_i | \\theta)$. While there are other methods to do the same, with a large enough sample size MLE is the most efficient estimator for the distribution parameter $\\theta$. Also, as sample size increases the estimater parameter tends to the true parameter and the error becomes normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of the MLE arises when you have non-regular distributions, i.e. distributions whose parameters are constrained by the observed values. For such distributions, a maximum likelihood may not exist. Similar problems can occur in cases where multiple maxima exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The AIC is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "AIC = -2 $\\sum_1^n log p(y_i | \\theta_{mle}) + 2 n_{parameters}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here $n_{parameters}$ refers to the number of parameters in the model and $\\theta_{mle}$ is the MLE estimate of $\\theta$. We want a model with a lower AIC and the second term is intended to penalize complex models by increasing the value of AIC. This can be seen as metric more suited for a non-Bayesian approach since it does not take into account any information regarding the uncertainty of the parameter.\n",

While is easy to equate this with variance, there are examples such as a Bimodal Gaussian distribution where increasing the variance does not increase the entropy. Entropy is a measure of the mass of probability density around a point whereas variance measures how far the probability mass extends from the mean. It is possibile to have two narrow modes that are far apart which would indicate a high variance but low entropy due to the relative certainty of the values (around the narrow modes).\n",

    "[Using Stacking to Average Bayesian Predictive Distributions](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/stacking_paper_discussion_rejoinder.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are several models that one can chose from, it is tempting to pick the one with the best performance (depending on how we defone performance). However, in doing so we are ignoring the uncertainty information provided by the other models. One way to mitigate this uncertainty is by performing model averaging. The meta-model obtained by using a weighted average of all the models can be used to make predictions. One way that this averaging is done is by computing the weights similar to using a softmax formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_i = \\dfrac{e^{-dE_i / 2}}{\\sum_j e^{-dE_j / 2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $dE_i$ is the difference in the WAIC value of the i'th model compared to the model with the lowest WAIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any Information Criterion metric can be used in this equation such as AIC. Averagin the models using the weights computed this way is called pseudo Bayesian Modeling Averaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Another technique that was proposed recently is the stacking of predictive distributions. The idea behind this is to combine models such that you minimize the divergence between the weighted metamodel and the true model. When a logarithmic score is used, similar to a KL Divergence, the following equation can be used\n",
    "\n",
    "$max_w \\dfrac{1}{n} \\sum_i^{n} log \\sum_k w_k p(y_i | y_{-i}, M_k)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where n is the number of data points and $M_k$ is the k'th model and $w_k$ is the weight applied to the k'th model. $y_{-i}$ is every element in y except $y_i$. The term $p(y_i | y_{-i}, M_k)$ corresponds to the predictive probability density using a Leave-One-Out cross validation procedure. The goal is to select the combination of weights that maximizes the probability of seeing $y_i$, thereby giving us the ideal metamodel that minimizes the divergence to our best of our knowledge based on the data available. Note here that argmax is computed over 'w' as opposed to 'n' as it listed in some resources."

    "### Ergodicity\n",
    "\n",
    "Ergodicity is a critical property for a Markov Chain which combine the properties of a state being recurrent and aperiodic. Recurrent implies that, in a transition, a given state will return to itself. An aperiodic state returns to itself in a number of steps 1,2,3.... $\\infty$. The implications of ergodicity are that if we sample a space long enough we will cover almost every point in that space (theoretically)\n",

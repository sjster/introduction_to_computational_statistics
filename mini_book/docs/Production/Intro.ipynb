        "Likelihood is a type of probability except that this describes the probability of the data that has already been observed given a certain hypothesis parameter. Probability, in general, refers to the possibility of occurence of future events. It is worthwhile to draw the distinction between probability and likelihood here. Probability refers to varying data given a fixed hypothesis parameter(s). Likelihood refers to variable hypothesis for the fixed observed data. If 'x' represents our data and \\\\(\\theta\\\\) represents our hypothesis parameter, the Likelihood is written as\n",

        "$$ Likelihood(\\theta | data) = P(x | \\theta) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "It is worth pointing out likelihood does not form a valid probability since the Probability Density Function formed by varying theta with the observed data does not integrate to 1. It is for this reason that the term likelihood exists, i.e. to remind us that it is not a valid probability density.\n",

        "#### Inference \n",
        "\n",
        "Inference refers to the process of identifying the distribution for the parameters that represent our hypothesis. However, this is a distinctly Bayesian definition of Inference, since a Frequentist believes in the existence of true parameter. We will spend some time understanding these differences in the next section. The posterior distribution is computed during the inference step and can be denoted as\n",

        "\n",
        "In frequentist statistics, our probabilities are only based on what we have observed. In Bayesian statistics, we also use our prior understanding of the environment or the system that generated the observations to infer the possibility of future events. As Ben Lambert says in his book 'A Students Guide to Bayesian Statistics', 'for Bayesians it is unnecessary for events to be repeatable in order to define a probability. They are merely abstractions to help express our uncertainty'. The fundamental difference between a Bayesian and a Frequentist point of view is determined by how one treats parameters and data. For a Frequentist, the uncertainty associated with a probability assigned to an event comes from randomness (aleatoric uncertainty), they do not consider the uncertainty arising from a lack of knowledge (epistemic uncertainty).\n",

        "\n",
        "Data is fixed and in light of new data we update our beliefs. The belief represented by some parameter is a random variable that we update. They are comfortable with the idea that our knowledge of these parameters evolve over time. In the case where there is a true parameter value that can be estimated, Bayes theorem allows one to specify an uncertainty over this parameter.\n",

        "#### The Frequentist\n",
        "\n",
        "Frequentist - The data is the result of sampling from a random process. They see the data as varying and the parameter of this random process that generates the data as being fixed. They view this parameter as being the average of an infinite number of experiments. This approach is particularly problematic for events that cannot be repeated.\n",

        "For example, in a coin flip that is repeated 5 times where 4 heads show up, the probability of heads for a frequentist would be 4/5. The distribution that represents the generative process of getting a heads or a tails from a coin toss can be represented by the parameter \\\\(\\theta\\\\). When we want to determine the number of heads from 'n' coin tosses, this can be modeled using a Binomial distribution. If 'O' represents the observed outcome and 'H' represents the outcome being heads, then the likelihood can be written as\n",

        "However, in this case we use a subjective prior to compute this posterior. We trade an arbitrary threshold (usually 1% or 5% depending on the problem being solved) in frequentist statistics for a subjective prior in Bayesian statistics. One could argue that both of these are different ways to incorporate domain-knowledge and subjective expertise into the decision making process. Bayesians, however, do not need to accept or reject a hypothesis since they have the full distribution available as a result of the posterior and can therefore quantify the uncertainty with the hypothesis. More information about hypothesis testing is in the section below."

        "Hypothesis testing using significance testing is performed by formulating a null hypothesis, and testing the probability of an event having occurred under this null hypothesis. If this probability is less than a predefined theshold (usually 5% but is very much context dependent), we reject the null hypothesis otherwise we say that the event has a reasonable chance of occuring under the null hypothesis. The general notion behind the null hypothesis is that this is a hypothesis we want to prove wrong, the opposite of the null hypothesis is the alternate hypothesis. P-values and confidence intervals are routinely used in research to convey the credibility of experiments. However, these p-values depend on the [experimental setup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_principle#Experimental_design_arguments_on_the_likelihood_principle).\n",

        "Suppose we have a group of measurements for temperatures in Virginia for the month of December in 2020. It turns out that the mean temperature is 45F. The mean temperature across all the years from 1980 to 2020 was 50F. We want to test if this was an anomaly or not using NHST with p-values. Our null hypothesis here is that this is not an anomaly and the alternate hypothesis is that this was an unusually colder December. We have to select a threshold to accept or reject our hypothesis, as mentioned above this threshold is usually selected to be 5%. In order to confirm our suspicion we must reject the null hypothesis. We start by obtaining the probability of the data occurring under the null hypothesis, i.e. the probability of the mean temperature in 2020 given the distribution of mean temperatures from 1980 to 2020. If this probability is less that 5%, we reject the null hypothesis saying that it is unlikely for the data in 2020 to have come from the null hypothesis distribution. It is therefore a colder winter than Virginia is accustomed to seeing. If the probability is greater than 5%, we fail to reject the null hypothesis since there is some reason to believe (based on our subjective threshold) that this data could have been produced by the null hypothesis distribution. It is therefore no colder than expected and hence not an anomaly.\n",

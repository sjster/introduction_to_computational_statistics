    "## Covid Modeling with PyMC3 - Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is based on the work done by the Priesemann Group for inferring the parameters for COVID-19 and performing predictions. An overview of the methods can be found [here](https://pad.gwdg.de/s/ByQgsSP88).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain the data that has the number of COVID-19 cases starting from January for each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select a country of choice to infer the COVID-19 parameters and extract the number of confirmed cases (You will need the total population of the country that you select).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the SIR model as a disease model ([Notebook].(https://github.com/sjster/Epidemic/blob/master/Epidemic.ipynb)). This is a set of non-linear differential equations that are used to model disease propagation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Setup a PyMC3 model to infer the SIR parameters from the number of confirmed cases (S,I, mu, lambda).\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. Select appropriate priors for each variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b. Use a Lognormal distribution for I_begin.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c. λ is the fraction of people that are newly infected each day. Use a Lognormal distribution for this.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   d. μ is the fraction of people that recover each day. Use a Lognormal distribution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   e. The prior of the error of observed cases can use a Half Cauchy distribution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Predict cases into the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Compare the predictions with the real observations and compute the error.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Note how the error varies as you increase the number of days chosen for the forecast.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Use appropriate metadata stores for experiment management. I have used the shelve module in Python but experiment with MLflow."

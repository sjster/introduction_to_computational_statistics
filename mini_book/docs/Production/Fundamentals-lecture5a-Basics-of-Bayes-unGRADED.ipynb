As we take the test, we are told that in our area, 5% of the population has the disease.\n\nWhat is our probability of having the disease??  Without other information, we are just a random draw from the population, so 5% is a good guess.\n\nWhat information do we know?\n$$P(disease) = 0.05; P(\\overline{disease}) = 0.95$$\n\nNote: \\\\(\\overline{disease}\\\\) means, compliment or NOT disease.\n\nWe then receive the results, the test comes back positive.  Are we in fact infected?  This question turns out to be less straightforward.  The reason this takes a bit more thought is the testing has error that needs to be accounted for.  The way to approach this question is through Bayes' Rule.\n\nWhat we want is the probability we have the disease given a positive test result:\n\n$$P(disease|+ test)$$\n\nBayes' Rule then gives this as:\n\n$$P(disease|+ test) = \\frac{P(+ test|disease)P(disease)}{P(+ test)}$$\n\nWhat are \\\\(P(+ test|disease)\\\\) and \\\\(P(+ test)\\\\)?  The first, \\\\(P(+ test|disease)\\\\) is the sensitivity of the test, or *true positive rate*.  For one of the COVID-19 tests, the test sensitivity is reported to be 80%.  What about \\\\(P(+ test)\\\\)?  Using the law of total probability, we are able to partition that into something more recognizable:\n\n$$P(+test) = P(+test|disease)P(disease) + P(+test|\\overline{disease})P(\\overline{disease})$$\n\n$$P(disease|+ test) = \\frac{P(+ test|disease)P(disease)}{P(+test|disease)P(disease) + P(+test|\\overline{disease})P(\\overline{disease})}$$\n\nPartitioning like this, we see we need one more item of information: \\\\(P(+test|\\overline{disease})\\\\) which is the *false positive rate*.  Tests usually report thier specificity, which is the *true negative rate* (\\\\(P(-test|\\overline{disease})\\\\) = ) rather than the FPR, so we need to convert:\n\n$$P(+test|\\overline{disease}) = 1 - P(-test|\\overline{disease}) = 1 - 0.989 = 0.011$$ \n\nWe can now answer our question:\n\n$$P(disease|+ test) = \\frac{0.8 \\ast 0.05}{0.8\\ast 0.05 + 0.011 \\ast 0.95} = 0.79$$\n\nNot 100%, but still high at 79%.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr style=\"border:2px solid blue\"> </hr>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"7a761e74-1619-411b-b416-95e7fd9c05a2"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Breaking down Bayes' Rule\n\nLet's go through the parts of Bayes' Rule.  We will go through this more completely in another section.\n\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n\n#### Posterior\n\nThe \\\\(P(A|B)\\\\) on the left hand side is termed the posterior.  It is the probability or likelihood of A, given B is true.  As we will see, in Bayesian analysis, we are often looking for the posterior to represent the distribution of the parameter given data.\n\n#### Likelihood\n\nThe term, \\\\(P(B|A)\\\\), is the likelihood.  In our disease example above, this was the probability of a positive test, given disease.  In future problems, we will be more interested in inference of parameters given data, such that the likelihood will represent the likelihood of observing the data given parameters.\n\n#### Priors\n\n\\\\(P(A)\\\\) is called the prior.  In the above example, this reflected our prior knowledge.  Before collecting (new) data, we had some notion of our probability of having disease.  It can represent a belief, it can be informed, or vague.\n\nAbove, we used a probability, the probability of disease based on the population was set to 5%.  We could have changed the prior to use a distribution, perhaps we had data of surrounding counties and knew the average was 5% with a defined variance.  Priors can also be used to induce a known distribution in the posterior.\n\n#### Marginal\n\nThe denominator, \\\\(P(B)\\\\), is the marginal probability of B.  This is a constant and in many analysis may be dropped.  \n\nUsing these terms, Bayes' Rule can be written:\n\n$$posterior = \\frac{likelihood \\ast prior}{marginal}$$\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr style=\"border:2px solid blue\"> </hr>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"91483350-9e90-420a-99f2-17274c3f0ea8"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### GRADED EVALUATION (15 mins)\n\n1.
